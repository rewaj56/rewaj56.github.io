# Kati Kamayoo
Kati Kamayoo is designed to extract detailed product information from Daraz Nepal using Selenium for automation. It gathers data such as product titles, prices, and sales figures, which is then cleaned and stored in a MySQL database. This data is served through Flask and visualized with Chart.js, offering dynamic and interactive insights. The project is open to contributions, and I encourage anyone interested to explore and help enhance its features. 


## Features
- Scrapes product titles, current prices, original prices, and amount sold for products listed on Daraz Nepal.
- Uses Selenium to automate the process of fetching data from the website.
- Stores scraped data in a MySQL database for easy retrieval and management.
- Integrates Flask and Chart.js to render and visualize product data in interactive charts and tables.
